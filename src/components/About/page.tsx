        I&#39;m a junior web developer who is mostly self-taught, with a deep
        passion for programming and technology. I&#39;ve been learning for about
        three years now.
      </p>
      <p className="my-5">
        I studied Software Engineering at a vocational high school (SMK), but
        after graduating, I felt lost. Technically, I had the skills, but
        I&#39;didnt know where to go or how to start my career in programming.
        For about a year, I worked at a local restaurant before deciding to
        return to programming and seriously pursue a job in tech.
      </p>
      <p className="my-5">
        While I didn&#39;t start completely from scratch, I brought with me some
        hands-on experience. I previously interned at a software house, where I
        had the opportunity to learn and work with frameworks like Laravel and
        React. That experience helped shape my understanding of real-world
        development environments and sparked my drive to grow further as a
        developer.
